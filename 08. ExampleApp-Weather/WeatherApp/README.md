# WeatherApp Demo

This app requires a 3rd party API key from https://openweathermap.org. You can get your own free key
by signing up for an account, then creating a new API Key here:

https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys

Next you'll right-click on the `Configuration` folder in the Xcode sidebar, and select _Reveal in Finder_. Duplicate the file `Secrets.xcconfig-template` and rename it `Secrets.xcconfg`. Then edit the file and enter your API Key there.
